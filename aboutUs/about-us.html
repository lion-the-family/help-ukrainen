    <p  class="about_subtitle size">In May 2022 we established an organisation called 4Ukraine Humanitarian Aid. This is a non-profit organisation based in the UK, focussed primarily on the collection and delivery of humanitarian aid for the benefit of the children and people of Ukraine.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="about_subtitle size">Since our inception we have delivered over 250 tonnes of aid; numerous ambulances; 9 pick-up trucks; a mobile infectious disease treatment unit; over 1 billion water purification tablets; 20 water filtration systems; medical aid; 10,000 operating theatre gowns; Christmas gifts for children; clothing and thermal underwear; sanitary products; food, insect repellent; and much more. Through the relationships we have established within Ukraine we are able to deliver this aid quickly and directly to the areas it is needed most.</p>
    <p class="about_subtitle">In addition to the delivery of aid we have been instrumental in holding a summer camp in Wales for the children of the 1st London Plast-Ukrainian Scout Group. This summer camp was held for Ukrainian refugee children from around London and included specialist child psychologists specialised in helping children traumatised during through war. We have also relocated a Ukrainian family â€“ finding them work and accommodation in North London.</p>
